# Vinted Scraper

Originally created for my start-up.

Based on https://github.com/Giglium/vinted_scraper

Never finished the project, because we shifted away from the idea of scraping Vinted using our own tools and we started using the eBay API.

The tests don't pass and it might be outdated by now because Vinted changes the structure of their website every once in a while.

I used to host it on PythonAnywhere.

I also believe there are some files missing.
